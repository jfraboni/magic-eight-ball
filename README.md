# Installation

### On runnable.com:
Create a new node app, and from the terminal, enter or cut and paste the following commands, then press enter or return:
    
    git clone https://github.com/jfraboni/magic-eight-ball.git spark && spark/setup.sh
    
...some text will fly by as the repository is cloned locally and the project is setup.

Great, you're set to roll!

# Lesson Steps

Open up the magic-eight-ball.js file, and find:

**TODO 1 :** Here, create two variables in the same statement, one named `prompt` which will hold the prompt module, and one named `fs` to hold the file-system module:

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node

// TODO 1 : create variables for prompt and fs by calling require in each respective module:
var 
    prompt = require("prompt"),
    fs = require("fs")
    ;
```

Prompt and fs are modules, that is, libraries of code that provide some special functionality that we can reuse.

Think of including modules like including the various parts of a car:  A car is an assembly of parts - we need some headlights, an engine, a battery, wheels, etc, but someone else has constructed them for us, and in this case, prompt allows us to prompt the user for input, and fs, which means "file system", allows us to read and write to files on the computer.

Each module exposes a public API that provides some functionality, like prompting the user - we don't have to know how the prompt module works on the inside, just like we don't have to know how a battery works on the inside to hook it up to a car and make use of it.

To use modules, we state they are required by calling the node require method, like so, `var myModuleInstance = require('my-module')`, which takes a String representing the module and returns the instance of the module.

Notice the formatting of these variable declarations: `var` is on a line by itself, then on the next line and indented, we have the `prompt`, then a comma, new line, indented, then the `fs` declaration, and finally a semi-colon on the last line by itself.  This formatting simply points out that we're listing declarations in the same statement, and provides a cleaner way of looking at the source.

**TODO 2 :** Next, we'll create a variable to hold a welcome message and log it, this will print the welcome message back to the command line:
```javascript
// other code...

// TODO 2 : create a welcomeMessage variable and log the welcomeMessage:
var welcomeMessage = "Magic Eight Ball";
console.log(welcomeMessage);

// other code...
```
Nothing we haven't seen before!

**Run the App**
Switch to the command line, and go ahead and run the app like so:

    # ./magic-eight-ball.js

Whoa no!  An error...
    
    # ./magic-eight-ball.js
    Magic Eight Ball

    /root/magic-eight-ball.js:16
    fs.readFile(file, 'utf8', function (err, data) {
                ^
    ReferenceError: file is not defined
        at Object.<anonymous> (/root/magic-eight-ball.js:16:13)
        at Module._compile (module.js:456:26)
        at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:474:10)
        at Module.load (module.js:356:32)
        at Function.Module._load (module.js:312:12)
        at Function.Module.runMain (module.js:497:10)
        at startup (node.js:119:16)
        at node.js:906:3

Errors happen all the time, it's part of the process writing software, of hacking away until you get it right.  An error happens when an unexpected condition occurs, which essentially means, when the rules are broken.  When an error occurs, _if_ we don't <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling" target="_blank">handle it</a>, the program will crash!

Often, when an error occurs, the program will print to the screen what's called a stack trace, listing the path of execution through the program, up until the occurrence of the error.  You'll get to understand what all this stack trace gibberish means in no time, and determine just exactly where the problem is and how to implement a solution.

In the above stack trace, right under the line that says `Magic Eight Ball`, we read `/root/magic-eight-ball.js:16`.  This tells us the problem is on line 16 in our code.  Then, the next line:

    /root/magic-eight-ball.js:16
    fs.readFile(file, 'utf8', function (err, data) {

...we can see a little arrow underneath the culprit!

And then finally, we are informed of the type of error we raised: `ReferenceError: file is not defined`.  If you come across error types with which you're unfamiliar, _this_ is the part of the stack trace error message that you should Google to learn exactly what that error means.  Try it!  Google "JavaScript ReferenceError".

The stack trace gives us even more detail with `at Object.<anonymous> (/root/magic-eight-ball.js:16:13)`, the last numerical part of the line, `16:13`, informing us again that the problem is on line 16 in our code, but also giving us the character position on line 16 where the intepreter came across our unexpected condition, so if you count 13 characters in from the left side of the code, you'll find the problem.

In this case, we are asking the program to use a variable called `file`, but that variable has yet to be defined because we have not created it!  And thus the message, `ReferenceError: file is not defined`.

Eureka!  Now, let's go back to our code and _define_ our `file` variable!  In fact, we'll define a few variables...

**TODO 3 :** Right then, let's set up a few more variables:  First an Array to hold our possible answers, and then we'll assemble the full file path to the `answers.json` data that we're about to load.  On `__dirname`, notice the double underscore prefix.  `__dirname` is a built in node feature that gives us the system-specific path to our current directory, which will be different depending on the machine and operating system, etc, in other words, we certainly wouldn't want to hardcode a full path:

```javascript
// TODO 3 : create two variables, the answers array and the file path to the answers.json:
var answers = [];
var file = __dirname + "/answers.json";
```

**Run the App!**

    # ./magic-eight-ball.js
    Magic Eight Ball

Awesome, all systems green, we quashed the bug!  But not much going on in our app yet...

**TODO 4 :** Check out this deal: We use a for-in loop to iterate over all the items in the data.answers array (see the structure of that <a href="http://www.json.org/js.html" target="_blank">JSON</a> data in the answers.json data in the same directory).

The for-in loop cycles through all elements in a list (either Array or object), and assigns to the variable just inside the open-parentheses (in this case, we called that variable `index`), the index (in the case of iterating an Array) or the key (in the case of iterating an Object), which we can then use to look up the value at that index or key.  Loops are the mechanism by which you'll process and consume Arrays (lists of things) and other data-sets, so it's best to familiarize yourself with them.

<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp" target="_blank">Here's a list of all the loops in JavaScript</a>

```javascript
// TODO 4 : Loop through the data.answers objects, and push answer-records into the answers array:
for (index in data.answers) {
    answers.push(data.answers[index].value);
}
```

Let's take a minute to talk about this crazy method call:

```javascript
fs.readFile(file, "utf8", function (err, data) {
  if (err) { return onErr(err); }

  data = JSON.parse(data);

  // TODO 4 : Loop through the data.answers objects, and push answer-records into the answers array:
  for (index in data.answers) {
      answers.push(data.answers[index].value);
  }

  // TODO 5 : Invoke the promptForQuestion() function:
  
});
```

Here, we're using the readFile API of the fs (file-system) module to load our answers.json file.  Again, we don't need to know too much about what's going on inside, we just need to meet certain requirements, or fulfill a contract outlined by an _interface_.  In this case, the readFile method takes the directory path to the file, which includes the file name.  Next, we set a standard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8" target="_blank">utf8 encoding</a>, but don't worry about this for now.  Most interestingly is the next argument, which is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function" target="_blank">anonymous function</a>.  This is a pretty powerful pattern that you'll see often in JavaScript and node, where _we pass a function that will be executed once some other process has completed_, in this case, the file has been read.

On load complete, our anonymous function is executed, wherein we use the JSON.parse API to read our JSON string and convert the String to a JavaScript Object structure.  Once parsed, we look inside that Object for an Array of answers, and for this version of the app, we don't care about other any other values in that data except for the value of the answer, so we grab each answer and push it into a simple Array. 

Let's do one more thing before we run our app again...

**TODO 5 :** Moving on, now that we've loaded our data, we're ready to rip, so let's prompt the user to ask our magic eight ball a question: invoke the promptForQuestion() method, like so:

```javascript
// other code...

// TODO 5 : Invoke the promptForQuestion() function:
promptForQuestion();

// other code...
```

Let's go over the prompt boilerplate, which we wrote for you:

We create a variable called `properties`, which contains some configuration values for the prompt, including the message we will display to the user on the screen.  Next, we declared a function called `promptForQuestion`; we do this so we can reuse this functionality and show the prompt again without having to rewrite all the code required to do so.  Inside the `promptForQuestion` function, we call `start` on the `prompt` Object - this initializes the prompt, and then we call `prompt.get` and pass our properties and a callback function that will handle our user's response.

```javascript
var properties = [
  {
    name: "input", 
    validator: /^[A-Z].+(\?)$/,
    message: "\nAsk the magic eight ball a question>",
    required: true,
    warning: "Whoa now, that doesn\'t seem like a proper question:\nWe must be polite to the magic eight ball,\nso please make certain you start your question with a capital and end it with a question mark.\nFor example, \"Will I win the lottery?\". Try again."
  }
];

function promptForQuestion() {
  prompt.start();

  prompt.get(properties, function (err, input) {
    if (err) { return onErr(err); }

    // TODO 7 : Invoke the showResponse() function, passing in a random index from the answers array:
    
  }); 
}
```

Alright...

**Run the App!**

    # ./magic-eight-ball.js
    Magic Eight Ball
    prompt:
    Ask the magic eight ball a question>:  Is this lesson done yet?
  
Nice!  Our app prompts the user to ask the magic eight ball a question, that's exactly what we want!  Now we have a mechanism for collecting user input, and this will be a very powerful tool!

Notice, when asking the magic eight ball a question, if you do not capitalize the first word of your sentence, or if you do not end the sentence with a question mark, the magic eight ball will get mad and tell you:
  
    # ./magic-eight-ball.js
    Magic Eight Ball
    prompt:
    Ask the magic eight ball a question>:  will I get a job at Google
    error:   Invalid input for
    Ask the magic eight ball a question>
    error:   Whoa now, that doesn't seem like a proper question:
    We must be polite to the magic eight ball,
    so please make certain you start your question with a capital and end it with a question mark.
    For example, "Will I win the lottery?". Try again.
    prompt:
    Ask the magic eight ball a question>:  Will I get a job at Google?

This is a process known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_validation" target="_blank">_input validation_</a>, and you'll see this pattern often in software projects.  In our app, we use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression" target="_blank">regular expression</a>, which we create as the `validator` in the `properties` object, and pass to the `prompt.get()` method.  A regular expression is a character sequence describing a search pattern used to find matches in strings.  We'll learn more about them in a later lesson, but here's what ours looks like:

```javascript
validator: /^[A-Z].+(\?)$/,
```

Our validator regular expression checks the input from our user, and makes sure the input is a valid question and properly formatted sentence that begins with an uppercase word.  So, above, that's why the first question to the magic eight ball, `will I get a job at Google`, fails our validation rules, and why the second question to the magic eight ball, `Will I get a job at Google?` passes our validation rules.

Alrighty...

**TODO 6 :** Okay, now let's get the magic eight ball ready to respond: create a function called `showResponse()` that takes one parameter, called `index`.  We log a result by randomly selecting an index within the range of the answers array:

```javascript
// TODO 6 : Create the showResponse() function:
function showResponse(index) {
  console.log("The Magic Eight Ball responds: " + answers[index]);
}
```

**TODO 7 :** Finally, the moment we've all been waiting for, let's randomly select the magic eight ball's response:

```javascript
// TODO 7 : Invoke the showResponse() function, passing in a random index from the answers array:
showResponse(randomNumberBetween(0, answers.length-1));
```

Here, we're invoking the showResponse() method, and before we do so, as an argument to the showResponse() method, we're passing in the result of another invocation, this one to the randomNumberBetween() method, where we ask for a random number between zero (remember, arrays are zero-indexed, so the first element in the answers array is at index 0) and the last possible index in the answers array, which we calculate by asking for the length of the array, minus one.  Why minus one here?  To offset for the fact, as previously mentioned, that arrays are zero indexed, so if we just took the length of the array as the high end of our range, we'd be out of bounds by one.

Go ahead and run the app, but be very careful what you ask for!
